# netoum

This is the **official netoum.com and Corex documentation site**, built as a minimal Vite project for a **Corex-powered design system**.

It is built with **Vite**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, the **Corex Themex template**, and a **Handlebars plugin**, providing a fast and flexible foundation for accessible, themeable UIs.

> **Note:** This project is open source and provided for educational purposes only. It is **not** intended to be used as a starter template or cloned for other projects, as it directly references Netoum and Corex assets.
