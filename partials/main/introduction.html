    <h1>Introduction to Corex</h1>

    <p><strong>Corex</strong> is a UI component library built with web fundamentals: pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla
      JavaScript/TypeScript. Designed for flexibility and accessibility, Corex provides modular components that
      integrate seamlessly into any project.</p>

    <h2>Core Principles</h2>

    <p>Corex is built on web standards with a focus on accessibility, flexibility, and developer experience. Every
      component is crafted to work across different environments while maintaining consistent behavior and styling.</p>

    <h3>Web Standards Foundation</h3>
    <p>Components are built with semantic HTML, modular CSS, and vanilla JavaScript/TypeScript. This approach ensures
      compatibility across frameworks, static sites, and any web environment without dependencies or build requirements.
    </p>

    <h3>Accessibility First</h3>
    <p>Interactive components are powered by <a href="https://zagjs.com/components/react/checkbox" target="_blank"
        class="link link--font-brand">Zag JS
        {{> icon/external}}
      </a>, a headless state machine library that provides robust accessibility patterns. Every component includes
      proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support by default.</p>

    <h3>Flexible Architecture</h3>
    <p>Corex components are designed to adapt to your workflow and design requirements, offering multiple integration
      paths and styling approaches.</p>

    <h2>Component Structure</h2>

    <h3>Static Components</h3>
    <p>Form elements, buttons, badges, and links components built with semantic HTML and CSS. These components require
      no JavaScript and work immediately upon inclusion.</p>

    <h3>Interactive Components</h3>
    <p>Complex components like dialogs, dropdowns, tooltips, and switches built on top of <a
        href="https://zagjs.com/components/react/checkbox" target="_blank" class="link link--font-brand">Zag JS
        {{> icon/external}}
      </a>. These components provide accessible state management and keyboard interactions while remaining
      framework-agnostic.</p>

    <h2>Styling Flexibility</h2>

    <h3>Export Formats</h3>
    <p>Every component is available in multiple formats to match your preferred development approach:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Unstyled</strong>: Pure HTML structure with semantic markup for complete custom styling</li>
      <li><strong>CSS</strong>: Modular CSS files with custom properties for direct customization</li>
      <li><strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>: Pre-configured utility classes that integrate with Tailwind workflows</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Design Token Integration</h3>
    <p>Corex supports flexible theming approaches:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>CSS Variables</strong>: Direct customization through CSS custom properties</li>
      <li><strong>Design Tokens</strong>: Integration with <strong>Tokens Studio</strong> and <strong>Style
          Dictionary</strong> for design tool workflows</li>
      <li><strong>Token Generation</strong>: Build comprehensive design systems from centralized token sources</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technical Approach</h2>

    <p>Built with simplicity in mind, Corex components use standard web technologies that developers can easily
      understand, modify, and integrate. No complex abstractions or hidden configurationsâ€”just straightforward HTML,
      CSS, and JavaScript that works.</p>
